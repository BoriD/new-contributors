## New Contributors

Welcome to our
[dataobservatory.eu](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/) R, hugo,
and open data ecosystem. We are very happy to guide you to the
experience of open source development and open knowledge management
regardless of your experience level with R or Github. We kindly ask you
to take the Contributor Covenant Pledge before starting our
collaboration.

“We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation
in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.”

Please read the [entire covenant
here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

-   [x] Name, affiliation, education details, one-line and short
    biography. Please, send back this [bio_template.txt text
    file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors/main/biography/bio_template.txt)
    with your details or, if you know markdown, use [this
    version](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors/blob/main/biography/_index.md).
    The files are identical, but your word processor may not know how to
    open an .md file.
-   [x] Your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) to resolve ambiguity with
    similarly named people. You may use different library or publication
    service IDs, such as Google Scholar, Publeon, etc, you may provide
    them, too, but we do need an ORCiD ID, because most of the EU open
    science infrastructure and the R ecosystem uses this one. If you do
    not have it, please create one—it only takes a few minutes. Please
    add it to the bio_template.txt.
-   [x] Your LinkedIn ID, add it to the bio_template.txt.
-   [ ] Your Github account name. If you do not have one, please create
    one. As a data curator, you may not need it, but if you contribute
    in our R&D or publication efforts, you will need it.
-   [ ] Your Keybase account name. If you do not have one, please create
    one, if you want to be able to chat with us, or exchange calls, data
    with us in a discrete, free, open-source and secure environment.
    Keybase is an open-source substitute for Slack. It is owned by Zoom
    and it can start Zoom or Google Meet calls.
-   [ ] Twitter account name, provided that you use Twitter for
    *professional* uses.
-   [ ] Facebook acccount name, provided that you use Facebook for
    *professional* uses.
-   [ ] Any other social media that you use strictly professionally.
-   [x] You should follow our file naming conventions, and avoid the use
    of special characters in any file names at all times: <space>, `$`,
    `:`,`;`,`,`,`.`, `"`, `' tick` or backtick.
-   [x] Please send us one professional portrait of at least 400x400
    pixels.

## Data curators

Data curators do not need to be knowledgeable about data science or
programming. They should have a strong domain-specific knowledge and
interest in empirical data collection and data quality in their
professional or research areas.

As a data curator, we will rely on your expertise to publish or release
new data. Therefore, we need a filled in curator biography template with
the following information about you.

You should get familiar with the following concepts. We will describe
them in blogposts.

-   [x] [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
    improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse
    of digital assets.
-   [x]
    [DataCite](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-44):
    A persistent, standardized approach to access, identification,
    sharing, and re-use of datasets—this is our favored way of
    describing data for future use according to the FAIR principles.
    Many EU open science repositories will ask your publications with
    this documentation.
-   [x] Biblatex is a standard text file used by citation engines,
    bibliography management tool, and in scientific publication
    templates. (See for example the Overleaf [Biblatex
    tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Getting_started_with_BibLaTeX).
-   [ ] Dublin Core is an older international standard than DataCite,
    but the two standards greatly overlap. Dublin Core was originally
    developed by libraries. You often may need to fill out Dublin Core
    properties for publication.
-   [x] You should follow our file naming conventions, and avoid the use
    of special characters in any file names at all times: <space>, `$`,
    `:`,`;`,`,`,`.`, `"`, `' tick` or backtick.

## If you want to contribute, co-author in our publication activities

For co-authorship, you should be familar with tools that help the
assynchronous co-writing of papers. We use Github for mainly this
purpose.

Additionally we need this from you:

-   [ ] Your Github account name. Still not a must, but eventually it is
    in your interest to be able to work with Git.
-   [ ] Gaining familiarity with the TeX format for scientific
    publishing, exporting your citations to Biblatex format.
-   [x] Share citations with us with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/),
    and open-source bibliography management tool that integrates well
    with browsers. Share your Zotero account name with us.
-   [x] You should follow our file naming conventions, and avoid the use
    of special characters in any file names at all times: <space>, `$`,
    `:`,`;`,`,`,`.`, `"`, `' tick` or backtick.

We will softly onboard you if you are not familiar with Gitbhub, you can
start collaborating us in Google Docs.
