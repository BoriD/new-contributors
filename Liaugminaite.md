## Hello, world!

Good afternoon!

## Add a file to the png folder

Choose any png file that you like (and which is royalty free, not too
big), and place it on your drive to the `/png/subfolder` of your local
repository copy. The name of the png file should be changed below:

    # By the way this is how you include a png file as illustration from 
    # ../png/<your_filename>.png
    knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "1200px-Sunflower_sky_backdrop.jpg"))
