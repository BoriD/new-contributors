```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
```

## Find the repository

1. Go to the repository url on github. If the repository is public, you will see the page immediately. If it is private, you will see it as if it did not exist if you have no right to see it.

[github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors)



## Bookmark the repository

2. Star this repo: dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors 

```{r bookmark}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_star_repository.png"))
```

## Fork the repository

You create a branch, a version of the repository (folder), in your own github.com space in the cloud by creating a fork. This is the first step of the collaboration: you will always work with a copy of our files, and you will only overwrite master files with the repository manager's explicit approval.  

You will see, among other things, the following information:

_A_ fork _is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project._


```{r fork}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_create_fork.png"))
```
You will have a copy of the entire directory at `github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors`

## Download your copy

In the following screenshot, RStudio is used on an Ubuntu (Linux) computer.

```{r download}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_download_fork.png"))
```

- Downloading on a Windows version will be slightly different. Instead of using the SSH link, you will use the standard HTTPS link of the repository. 
- On Windows or Mac, you can use Github Desktop for synchronizing your folders. That is preferred to RStudio if you have large graphic files, PowerPoint presentations, or other large assets in the folder.

1. `github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors` is in sync with your online copy, i.e. 
`github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors`
2. Your computer has a copy in sync with `github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors`.

## Upstream sync

What happens if you have not opened the `<your_drive>/.../new-contributors` for some time? Maybe somebody changed the contents of `github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors`. If you want to stay in sync, you have to make sure first that your online copy is updated from the master repository. 

```{r forksync}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "githu_sync_fork.png"))
```

1. By pressing the Synch fork button, you can make sure that `github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors` is in sync with your online copy, i.e. 
`github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors` again.
2. You must pull any changes in the 'upstream fork' or the master folder down to your computer to make sure that `github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors` is again in sync with your local copy on `<your_drive>/.../new-contributors` 

## Pull down new contents

You must write a meaningful message for your colleagues.

I am uploading now the screenshots of this tutorial



## Synchronize changes

In this case, I use RStudio on an Ubuntu computer to send the files. The steps are the same on Windows or Mac, and they are essentially the same if you use GitHub Desktop for synchronizing a folder.  The user interface will look different.

1. You select the files that you want to upload, or push up. 

```{r commitfiles}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "rstudio_files_commit.png"))
```

2. You commit to sending the files up into the cloud. If the repository on github.com is public, you will make the files public, so think this step through.

```{r commit2}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "rstudio_files_commit_2.png"))
```

3. You must write a meaningful commit message. Why? If you had a previous task description ('issue'), link or reference to it. Later you can undo these changes, and the better you describe them, the easier you will find this step and correct it, should you need it. Even more important: whoever will synchronize your changes to the team's master repo will know what happened.


```{r stage}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "rstudio_stage_files.png"))
```

4. Push the green arrow up, and the files will be uploaded to `github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors`.


## Did the new files arrive?

Go to `github.com/<your_username>/new-contributors` and check if the new files are there. In this case, I changed the `Rmd` and `md` version of this tutorial, and added the screenshots as `png` files to the `/png` folder in the repository.

```{r visualcheck}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_new_commit_arrives.png"))
```
As you can see, in the cloud, on `github.com/antaldaniel/new-contributors` I can see that the new files are there with my short commit message.

I also see a message that `This branch is 1 commit ahead of dataobservatory-eu:main`. One bunch of changes were committed to change the dataobservatory-eu team's master repository. How will I make sure that the original, public, joint folder, i.e. [github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/new-contributors) will be updated?

## Sync with your team

1. On `github.com/<your-username>/new-contributors` you go to 'pull requests' 

```{r pr1}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_pull_request_1.png"))
```

1. On `github.com/<your-username>/new-contributors` you go to 'pull requests' 

```{r pr2}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",   "github_pull_request_2.png"))
```
3. You must give clearer instructions on this pull request. One pull request may contain many files, i.e. not only one commit, but many files from several commits in one go. Therefore, it is a good practice to write a short summary of all the changes you would like to do in the team's master repository.

```{r mergefork3}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_merge_fork_3.png"))
```

4. Press `Create pull request` and **stop**. After the pull request is made, you will get a confirmation of what changed, but if you are offered, to not make the last step.

```{r mergefork4}
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "linux",  "github_merge_fork_4.png"))
```
5. **Do not press `Merge pull request`** if you see it. Normally only your supervisor should see it.
